## ðŸ”§ Pipeline Overview

This project builds a **model training pipeline** for **image classification** using:
- **Optuna** for automatic hyperparameter optimization.
- **MLflow** for experiment tracking (logs, checkpoints, hyperparameters,...).
- **PyTorch Lightning** to simplify training loops and organize code clearly.

The pipeline operates completely automatically:
1. Train neural networks with the FashionMnist dataset
2. **Create an Optuna study** to run multiple training trials with different hyperparameters, optimizing for validation accuracy.
3. **MLflow** records all information for each trial: model, val/test accuracy, checkpoints,...
4. Automatically stop inefficient trials early with `EarlyStopping` and `PruningCallback`.
5. Automatically save and reload checkpoints with the best validation accuracy.

> ðŸ”¥ **Innovations / creative points**:  
> - Fully integrates all 3 modern tools: PytorchLightning + Optuna + MLflow.
> - Restructured pipeline for easy expansion, easy management of logs and models.
> - Can run with just one command line (`python pl_optuna.py -p`), everything else is automated.

## Installation Guide

1. Clone the project from GitHub:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PhucNg2k/MLOPS-LAB1.git
   cd MLOPS-LAB1
   ```
2. Install the necessary libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage Guide

**Step 1: Start the MLflow Server**

Open a terminal and run the following command to start the MLflow server:

```bash
mlflow server --host localhost --port 8080
```

The MLflow interface will be available at http://localhost:8080.

**Step 2: Run the training script**

Open another terminal and run the training script with pruning enabled:

```bash
python pl_optuna.py -p
```

## Results

The results of each trial will be displayed in the terminal (accuracy, params,...).

MLflow UI will store:

+ Hyperparameters, metrics
+ Best model checkpoints
+ Logs, artifacts

Run names will be set with readable identifiers (E.g.: Trial:0_14/04/2025_18:32)

## Notes
Make sure the mlflow server is started before running the training script.

You can modify the pl_optuna.py file to customize experiments according to your needs.
